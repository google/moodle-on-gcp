# Deploying Ingress

This session is designed to support customers and partners in getting the ingress controller deployed with GKE. Currently, there are two possible ways to get it done.

1. [Leveraging Google Cloud Load Balancer (recommended)](deploying-ingress-cloud-load-balancer.md)
2. [Leveraging NGINX](deploying-ingress-nginx.md)

You can use the links above to see the details about how to implement the approach that makes more sense to your scenario. More possibilities are about to come.
