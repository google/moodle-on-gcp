- Added NGINX based deployment in 5a-deployment-no-helm folder
- Added and improved docs for NGINX based deployment.
- Added a sample configmap for NGINX based deployment.

- NGINX based deployment added several performance features:
  Based on Moodle 4.0.2 Stable tar.gz from Moodle's github repo.
  PHP 8.1 with cli and PHP8.1-FPM.
  Auto installation and generation of final config.php file pointing to Redis as the default Application and Session store.
  Added moosh (Moodle Shell) within the NGINX based image to facilitate Moodle operations from command line.
  Refactored MOODLE root path within NFS to facilitate differentiation of different Moodle installs within the same Filestore instance.
  Added JIT support for Opcache, as this makes PHP much faster.
  Provided a baseline requests and limits that supports 200k+ students.
  (This also relies on setting up Redis Enterprise with high IOPS settings and a beefed up MySQL with read replica(s) to achieve these numbers.)
  (It may also require deploying Proxy SQL to control open database connections)
